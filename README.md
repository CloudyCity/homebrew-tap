# homebrew-tap
My own homebrew tap. Currently featuring `subversion18` (copied from `versions/subversion18`) with new unicode-path option, since this option was removed from `versions/subversion18`. 
*Caution:* experimental and unsupported!

## Usage
```
brew tap tholu/tap
brew install --with-unicode-path tholu/tap/subversion18
```
